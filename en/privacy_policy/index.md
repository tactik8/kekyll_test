# Privacy Commitment
Effective August 22, 2023

## Preamble and purpose
Your privacy is important to {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.legalName.en }} Inc. and its affiliates (“{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }},” “we,” “us” or “our”). That’s why we are implementing reasonable and transparent privacy practices. The purpose of this Privacy Commitment (the “Commitment”) is to inform you of these practices.

This Commitment describes all of our privacy practices, which are designed to protect the Personal Information (“PI”) that we collect and handle in the course of our business activities and the maintenance of our business relationships, in accordance with applicable laws. It applies to all your interactions with {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }}.

“Personal Information” or “PI” means any information about an individual that can be used to identify that individual, either directly or indirectly.

## Person in Charge of the Protection of Personal Information
{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} has appointed a Person in Charge of the Protection of Personal Information (“PCPPI”).

## Personal Information collected by {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }}

{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} only collects PI that is necessary for its activities. This includes information relating to your identity, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, payment information and information relating to the use of {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }}’s web platforms.

## Purposes of collecting Personal Information
We collect PI about you for a variety of purposes that we have previously identified, that you have consented to, or that are permitted by law.

In general, and without limitation, we collect PI for the following purposes:

- Provide access to our web and mobile platforms

- Manage the web platforms, identify trends and draw statistics relating to their use, evaluate their performance and improve our services

- Establish and maintain business relationships with our customers

- Deliver, invoice, collect payment for orders, and follow up on orders, requests for quotes and similar requests

- Get to know our customers better to provide them with relevant products and services, in particular through targeted advertising and surveys, and optimize our operations

- Provide you with relevant information via our web platforms and communications based on your preferences and purchasing and shopping habits

- Enable you to access the financing services of our partners

- Consider your application if you apply for a job with us via our Careers section

- Respond to communications sent to us

- Confirm your identity, verify the accuracy of your PI and update it

## Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information
{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} collects, uses and discloses your PI on the condition that it has obtained your consent in accordance with applicable requirements, except in certain specific cases provided by law.

If {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} needs to use or disclose your PI for purposes other than those that you have consented to, it will again seek your consent, except in cases where such consent is not necessary to make other uses or where exceptions are provided by law.

You may withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your PI for purposes that are not essential to the provision of our products and services, as set out in Section 12 of this Commitment.

## How we collect your Personal Information

### From you
Most of the PI we collect is information that you provide directly to us when you:

- Make a purchase online or in store
- Create a customer account online or in store (Customer Login)
- Contact us
- Take part in our surveys
- Subscribe to our communications
- Apply for a job online

### From third parties
{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} may also collect PI about you from third parties, but only with your consent or as permitted by law.

### Through our web platforms
{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} and its business partners may also collect other information related to your use of our web platforms, including your customer account, using cookies and web beacons. We use this information to learn about how you interact with our web platforms, improve our web platforms and product and service offerings, better understand your interests, and display advertisements that are relevant to you. Where necessary, {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} will obtain your consent before collecting such information.

## How we limit the disclosure of your Personal Information
{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} employees can access PI on a need-to-know basis, i.e., when the PI is necessary for them to perform their duties.

The PI collected may be disclosed to:

Suppliers in the performance of service contracts, such as suppliers of advertising, payment and financing services and technological solutions
Courts, regulators, government officials or lawyers, and any other party charged with investigating or enforcing the law (including to enforce or defend our rights and for debt collection purposes)
We will ensure that only the necessary PI is disclosed in each case. Any disclosure to a supplier will be governed by a contract which provides for the implementation of security measures and the destruction of data once the service has been provided. We do not sell or rent out your PI.

## How we limit the retention of your Personal Information
We will only retain your PI for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including to comply with legal, accounting and disclosure requirements and to enforce or defend our rights. For example, when you use our app to find your nearest store, we do not retain your store preference; that information is saved in a cookie on your device.

Generally, your PI is stored in Canada and our web platforms are hosted in Canada. However, business partners with whom we share PI may store it in other countries. In such cases, {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} will review the applicable laws and practices regarding the protection of PI in that country and ensure that your PI is adequately protected.

## Commercial electronic communications
We comply with Canada’s anti-spam legislation in our commercial electronic communications, including emails, text messages and social media.

If we collect your email address, mobile phone number or social media handle, we will use that information in a manner that complies with Canada’s anti-spam legislation. For example, we may only send you commercial electronic messages if we have your express consent or if we are permitted to do so by law. We may send you commercial electronic messages within two years of a transaction or within six months of a request for our services.

If you no longer wish to receive commercial electronic messages, you may withdraw your consent at any time. However, Canada’s anti-spam legislation contains exceptions that allow us to send you certain electronic messages, including reminders and messages sent for security purposes or to confirm or complete a transaction.

## Security measures
We take the security of our information systems and your PI seriously. The security measures that we have in place (including physical, electronic and organizational measures) are appropriate to the sensitivity of the PI that we hold and are subject to independent audits.

Use of our web platforms involves the exchange of encrypted information, primarily when you provide us with payment information or log in to your customer account. When you make an online purchase, your credit card information may be stored by our payment service provider, which takes the security measures required by credit card issuers. {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} does not retain this information.

We use a number of security measures to adequately protect your PI and minimize the risk of a breach. However, there is always a risk, and therefore we cannot guarantee 100% that the confidentiality or integrity of your PI will not be compromised in the event of a breach of our security measures.

## Your rights and how to exercise them
{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} respects your legal rights with regard to your PI and has set up procedures to deal with the following requests:

### Access and rectification: 
You have the right to access the PI that we have collected about you, check its accuracy, make any necessary changes and request a copy of it, subject to the exceptions provided by law. You can also modify some PI directly in your customer account on our web platforms.

### Withdrawal of consent
In certain circumstances, you also have the right to withdraw your consent to the use of your PI for purposes that are not essential to the provision of our products and services, including the provision of targeted advertising and surveys. If you choose to withdraw your consent to such use, this will generally result in the termination of your contractual relationship with us.

### Portability (effective September 2024)
You have the right to request that some of your PI be made available to you or another data controller in a structured, commonly used and readable format.

### Questions and complaints 
You may find that our Privacy Commitment does not answer your questions in sufficient detail. If this is the case, please contact the PCPPI as soon as possible. The contact details of the PCPPI are provided in Section 3. Similarly, any complaint about non-compliance with the principles set out in this Commitment should be made to the

Any enquiry relating to this section should be addressed to the PCPPI. {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} will respond to such requests within 30 days of receipt. If {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} is unable to meet this deadline or needs additional time to respond to a request, it will notify the Data Subject in writing.

## Commitment updates
### Applicable version
This Commitment is effective as of the date set forth above and supersedes all prior versions. {{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }}’s collection, use, disclosure and other handling of a Data Subject’s PI will be governed by the version of the Commitment in effect at that time.

### Changes to the Commitment
{{ site.data.website.sourceOrganization.name.en }} may modify this Commitment from time to time at its sole discretion. If the Commitment is amended, you will be notified of the changes by a notice posted on the home page of our web platforms and in our communication tools for a specified period of time.

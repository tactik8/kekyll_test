        <p>Terms of Use</p>

<p>website Name En</p>

<p>Introduction
Unless otherwise stated, the term “Site” refers to the current website of Organization1legalEn Ltd (“Organization1En”). In these Terms of Use (the “Terms”), users of the Site are referred to as “you.” Organization1legalEn Ltd is referred to as “Organization1En,” “we,” “us” and “our.” Your use of the Site is subject to these Terms and our Privacy Commitment. By using the Site, you confirm that you agree to comply with these Terms and that you consent to the contents of the Privacy Commitment, which may be amended by Organization1En from time to time without notice. Any transaction attempted or completed through the Site is also subject to the applicable laws and to the terms of sale described in the FAQ.</p>

<p>Protection of personal information
Your privacy is important to Organization1En. That is why we have security practices and measures in place to protect the personal information that we collect or that is provided to us from time to time, either directly or by someone with whom we do business. To learn more about how Organization1En collects and uses your personal information, as well as how Organization1En discloses it to third parties, please read our Privacy Commitment.</p>

<p>Creating an account
You do not need to create an account to shop on the Site. If you do create an account, the personal information collected will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Commitment.</p>

<p>You are responsible for protecting the password that you choose to log in to the Site and access your account. You may not share it with anyone, and you are responsible for ensuring that it is strong.</p>

<p>You are responsible for the transactions carried out under your account. If you make a purchase online, your payment information may be held by our payment service provider.</p>

<p>Organization1En reserves the right to suspend or delete your account for any legitimate reason, such as prolonged inactivity or fraudulent or suspicious activity related to your account. You may request that your account be deactivated at any time.</p>

<p>Intellectual property
The Site and its contents, including graphics, images, texts and audiovisual elements, as well as the source code and software or plug-ins incorporated therein (the “Content”), are protected by copyright and/or trademark laws and/or other intellectual property laws. Organization1En is the owner of the rights to the Content and the Site and of the licences granting it the right to use and distribute the Content and the Site. All intellectual property rights in the Content and the Site are reserved by Organization1En or their respective owners. Any reproduction, publication, creation of derivative works, or any other use of the Content or the Site without the consent of the owner of the intellectual property rights is prohibited.</p>

<p>Provided you comply with these Terms, Organization1En authorizes you to view, download and print a single copy of the Content and the Site solely for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you are a business customer. The use of the Content on any website other than the Site is prohibited.</p>

<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of framing or similar features is prohibited, as is any downloading or systematic querying of the Site for purposes other than indexing for a public search engine or in violation of the instructions contained in a robot.txt file. The use of the Content of the Site by a price aggregator is expressly prohibited.</p>

<p>Limitation of liability
Your use of the Site is at your own risk. Despite our efforts to avoid them, errors or inaccuracies may appear in the Content of the Site (particularly in product descriptions and photographs). Organization1En will not be liable for any damages arising from such errors. If you see something that you believe to be incorrect or inaccurate, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change any information on the Site (including product and service descriptions and prices) without notice.
Products or services advertised may not be available at the time of order or thereafter.
We may limit the number of products that can be purchased in any single transaction or series of transactions.
We reserve the right to cancel an order or not proceed with it (even if it has been accepted) if the price or any important information relating to it is incorrect. In such an event, we will notify you of the situation and credit you for the amount of the order if it has been paid for.
We provide the Site to you “as is.” We make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy of the Content or its operation. Although security measures are in place to protect the Site and our information systems, absolute security does not exist, and we cannot guarantee that the Site or the server that makes it available are or will be free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>

<p>You agree not to hold us responsible for the content of any hyperlink to which the Site may lead. More generally, you agree not to hold us liable for any damages arising from your use of the Site.</p>

<p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, Organization1En WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR REVENUE OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS ARISING OUT OF ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF Organization1En, ITS AGENTS OR AFFILIATES.</p>

<p>Terms of sale
Information on our terms of sale (price adjustment policy, delivery, returns, etc.) is available in the FAQ.</p>

<p>Modification or suspension of the Site
At its sole discretion and at any time, Organization1En may modify, interrupt or suspend the operation of the Site, any part of it or the Content, temporarily or permanently, without notice or liability to you.</p>

<p>Governing law
Any dispute arising from the use of the Site will be governed by the laws of Quebec and will be brought before a court in the judicial district of Joliette.</p>

<p>Changes to these Terms
